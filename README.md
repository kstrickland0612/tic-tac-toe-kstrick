Alt-H1 K Strickland Tic-Tac-Toe App
====================================

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe game, created during my time at General Asssembly's Software Engineering Immersive.
This project means a lot to me. Three weeks ago I wouldn't have kown where to even start building a browser-based game.

Simple as it seems, building this game taught me a lot.

- xoxo, K
